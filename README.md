# MiaVoice helps you in your smart home with voice controlled devices that a paralyzed person can control.

  # Why Do We Need MiaVoice API's?

  We need to connect all smart stuff in one system. Our company's principal activity, the most important one, is the automation of care. It is very useful to provide people with severe functional disorders with electronic devices that are tailored to their particular needs, and enable them to take daily care of themselves. This also makes the work of caregivers easier, to some extent, as some people who are paralyzed can perform daily care procedures themselves, without the help of others.â€‹

  # Technical Support What We Need

  We need: a quiet electric motor and a lot of electronic reducers for moving hospital bed & mini trains on the rails all around the home;
  We need: rails for these "trains" all around the roof, walls and flour;
  We need: room 3m x 7m x 2,55m (x,y,z) ass a standard room for these technologies;
  All that stuff works on 506625 Pa hydraulic, 12 V battery's, and a lot of magnetic relays, only one electric pump.

  # Why React Native?
  
  The same reason - one single code for all platforms. And a nice, readable, abstract style. 
  
  # Hello World Example
  
  A Hello, World program in React Native looks like this:

import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { AppRegistry, Text } from 'react-native';

export default class HelloWorldApp extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Text>Hello world!</Text>
    );
  }
}

// Skip this line if using Create React Native App
AppRegistry.registerComponent('HelloWorld', () => HelloWorldApp);

// The ReactJS code can also be imported into another component with the following code:

import HelloWorldApp from './HelloWorldApp';
