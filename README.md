  # Why Do We Need It?
  
  Our company's principal activity, the most important one, is the automation of care. It is very useful to provide people with severe functional disorders with electronic devices that are tailored to their particular needs, and enable them to take daily care of themselves. This also makes the work of caregivers easier, to some extent, as some people who are paralyzed can perform daily care procedures themselves, without the help of others.â€‹
